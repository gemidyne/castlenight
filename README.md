# castlenight
Castle_Night was a night-time arena map for Team Fortress 2, commonly used with the Versus Saxton Hale gamemode.  It was originally built purely as a night version of an existing VSH_Castle map, with permission from the original map author Sensei. The map ran on StSv Server #1 for some time.

## History
As mentioned above, the castle night map originally began life as just a night time version of an VSH_Castle map. However as time went on, cameos were added of Emily from Nightmare House 2. I was a big fan of NH2 at the time, and loved how that Source mod did horror. This eventually lead to the map being somewhat remodelled with more scares being added.

As more time went on, it became apparent that the map could become standalone as it's own gamemode. StSv Productions began development on an independant gamemode for this map (similar to control points but with more of a focus on map events) back in 2012/2013. The map was rebuilt from the ground up with the intention of becoming "Ghost Fortress 2". Unfortunately, this did not come to fruition and was left in a zip archive for many years.

## What's in this repository
- The final VMF file before the castle night map transitioned into an independant gamemode map. 
- The last compiled final BSP file.

I believe this is the version used in this video: https://youtu.be/3XXy_NNLUos

I have also uploaded the old versions of "Asylum" variant of this map - https://github.com/gemidyne/castlenight/releases/tag/1.0
The Asylum variants were rebuilds of the original map, but more focused on the creepy side of things. 

## What's not in this repository
- Any extra assets used by the original map. They appear to be lost to time unfortunately.

## A warning if you load this in-game as is
As this map is very old, there are a lot of missing models throughout the map. However, if you want to fix the map up into your own version - feel free! No permission needed. 
We would kindly ask if you can keep a link to www.gemidyne.com in your map (however we don't mind if you don't do this - its entirely up to you!)
